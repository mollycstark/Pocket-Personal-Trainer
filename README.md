Known Issues: 

Completed movements
- If user logs completed movements at any point, the server will always route them to create workout b even if now they'd like to make an unrelated workout
- If more than one user logs completed movements, application will not differentiate between different users completed movements; possible solution: get user's completed movements
- Filter through body region?

User errors
- Clicking navigation out of order breaks application
- After they create a workout, etc. need functionality to navigate back to homepage or user page
