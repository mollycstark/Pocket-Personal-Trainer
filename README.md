Nice to Haves
- List movement patterns for user?
- Give user notes about how to select sets/reps based on goals
- Flash a message that tells user how to user completed movements page and then have navbar on  page give them the option to alternatively return home 
- Horizontal/vertical push/pull
- User logout

Consider
- Headings across pages?
- Should page items be centered and if so when
- For a tablet should it be 2 or 3 movements across?
- Workout gets created as soon as you go to that page. Should think about alt solution - call create workout when they select a movement


To Do
- Background images vs. color palette for pages without movement images vs. collage
- Virtual env, requirements.txt, gitignore, readme - pip freeze > requirements. txt

Copy
- create customized exercise programs
achieve their fitness goals
specialized training plan
extensive library of workout movements
categorized by body part and functional movement patterns
build strength holistically 
functional training builds functional muscle
training for movement
correcting posture and muscle imbalances
instead of strengthening one muscle group at a time
research shows strength training has long term health benefits and doctors recommend adults strength train all major muscle groups twice a week
you need guidance to set up a strength training program tailored to your needs and a trainer can be expensive 
the best resistance training program works all the major muscle groups in your body
overworking one muscle group could raise your risk of injury
build muscle mass, get stronger, strengthen bones and joints
for optimal strength and fitness work all your muscle groups
start with lighter weights then increase the weight or resistance slowly to avoid injury
