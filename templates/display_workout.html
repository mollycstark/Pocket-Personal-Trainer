  <p>A note on set/repetition counts and recovery time: If your objective is
     strength or power (think: heavy lifting), the textbook advice is to 
     perform 3 to 5 sets of 2 to 6 reps per exercise. For hypertrophy 
     (building muscle), the sweet spot is 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 12 reps. And if
     your objective is muscular endurance, shoot for 2 to 3 sets of 12 to 20 
     reps.</p>

  <p>In each case, the key is to use the heaviest resistance that will allow 
    you to complete all of your reps and sets with good form. You also want to
     allow yourself just enough time to recover between sets to maintain a 
     high level of performance: 2 to 5 minutes for strength and power, 30 to 
     90 seconds for hypertrophy, and just 30 seconds for endurance.</p>
